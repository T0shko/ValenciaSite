 <h2>Prado museum</h2>
 <h3>The Prado Museum, which commemorated its 200th anniversary in 2019, 
    is the crown jewel of one of the city’s most popular tourist 
    itineraries: the Paseo del Arte, where you'll also find the 
    Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sofía museums. The Prado's walls are 
    lined with masterpieces from the Spanish, Italian and Flemish schools, 
    including Velázquez’ Las Meninas and Goya’s Third of May, 1808. 
    Its collection comprises 8,600 paintings and over 700 sculptures, 
    so we recommend deciding what you want to see before stepping into the 
    museum. If you are short on time, the Prado's website suggests three 
    itineraries, lasting 1, 2 and 3 hours and covering the museum's most 
    important masterpieces.

<h2>Plaza Mayor</h2>
<h3>Madrid’s grand central square is found in the heart of Hapsburg Madrid,
 the oldest part of the city. Steeped in history, the bustling plaza is 
 the perfect place to begin your stroll through one of Madrid’s most 
 charming districts. While you’re there, have a bite to eat or a coffee 
 at one of the sunny terraces, buy yourself a souvenir in any of the 
 time-honoured shops, watch street musicians and artists working their 
 magic, and soak up the city’s rich history. The square also plays host 
 to events such as the drum parade at Easter, outdoor concerts, and the 
 city's Christmas market in December, so be sure to check the calendar 
 when you're visiting.

<h2>Reina Sofia Museum</h2>
<h3>At one end of Paseo del Arte (Art Walk), you’ll find this iconic museum, 
    home to an impressive collection of modern and contemporary 
    (mainly Spanish) art of international renown. The Reina Sofía Museum 
    not only holds works by Dalí, Miró and Juan Gris, but it's also where 
    you'll find Pablo Picasso’s masterpiece Guernica, which immortalises 
    the suffering inflicted by the Guernica bombing of 27 April 1937 during 
    the Spanish Civil War.
